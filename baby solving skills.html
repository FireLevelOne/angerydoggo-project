<span>This, out of all things, needs the mosts maturity and common sense to comply.</span>
<span>This skill set mostly applies to if and when you are hired. Its probably the most improtant thing to have</span>
<span>Without it everytime you had a problem youd go and ask the manager on what to do. The manager can only take so much responsiblity and stress before they begin to break down and prove unfunctional.</span>
<br>

<br>
<span>How would you like it if you were a manager and you had to tell every worker every thing they had to do along the way, and after each task they completed they returned to there original spot huntched over with glazed eyes like that of a mindless imbecile.</span>
<br>
<p></p>
<span>These skills shouldnt be that hard to cover. As most humans aquire these skills through the struggles of their child hood and adolescence.</span>
