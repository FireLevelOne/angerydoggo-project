<strong> <h1>Networking</h1> </strong>
<strong>It's not what you know. It's who you know.</strong>
<br>
<p></p>
<span>If you know everything in a field, but you don't try to get to know anyone you probably won't get a job.</span>

  <h2>What is a Network?</h2>
  <div></div>
  <p>A network is comprised of all of the people you know and talk to. They can be extremely advantageous if you are applying for a job and someone from your "network" happens to employed by that company.
  <br>
<span>If you have someone on the inside of a company, and they put in a good word about you, that can change the tide of the game.</span>
<span>Without help from someone on the inside, your application is just another one of the hundreds flowing in the employers wind.</span>
<span>If you are applying for a job and someone you know works at that company, then they may be able to talk to the application manager and increase your chances of getting noticed for an interview.</span>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<span>Imagine if you were an employer short on staff, and you had tons of application flowing in daily. When you were scamming through the hundreds of them you remember one of your inferiors tell you to hire Bob "hes a good man" so instead of hiring the adverage Joe wouldn't you hire Bob?</span>
